## Getting started

After having been assigned a group, complete the following:

- [ ] Read the rest of this document in full.
- [ ] Create a new [Trello board](https://trello.com/) with your group. Include three columns: "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". Make sure everyone has access to the board.
- [ ] Have each member of the group read the guide on [working in groups](./docs/working-in-groups.md). Afterwards, discuss what you read about as a group.
- [ ] Read the project requirements in the [requirements](./docs/requirements.md) document. For each feature, build a new card in the Trello.
- [ ] Once you have built the cards you believe you need, prioritize the cards so that the most important are towards the top.
- [ ] Have one person create a repository on GitHub. Invite your group members to be able to work on the repository.
- [ ] Submit your URL _now_ even though you will only have one commit.

One goal of this project is to practice working on projects together. Therefore, it is OK if the process above takes some time. It's part of what is required to complete this project!
